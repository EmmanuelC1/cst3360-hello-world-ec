               <p>Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a binary. Translating programming language into binary is known as compiling. Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.</p>
